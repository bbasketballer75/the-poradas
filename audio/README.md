# Background Music Setup

## 📁 Audio File Location
Place your background music file in: `audio/wedding-background.mp3`

## 🎵 Recommended Audio Settings
- **Format:** MP3 or OGG
- **Duration:** 3-5 minutes (it will loop automatically)
- **Volume:** Medium level (the website will adjust volume automatically)
- **Type:** Instrumental or soft background music that won't compete with the main video

## 🎛️ How It Works
- Music starts playing automatically after the intro video
- It lowers volume when the main wedding video plays
- Guests can control it with the floating player in the bottom-left corner
- It follows the page as guests scroll

## 📝 To Add Your Music:
1. Save your audio file as `wedding-background.mp3`
2. Place it in the `audio/` folder
3. Test the website to ensure it plays correctly

The music player will appear in the bottom-left corner and allows guests to pause/play and control volume!
